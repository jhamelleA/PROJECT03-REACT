Todo & Contact Manager
Developer: Jhamelle Acoff

Overview
This project is a dynamic React-based web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks while providing a streamlined way to get in touch via a controlled contact form. The application demonstrates core React concepts, including state management, conditional rendering, and client-side routing.

Functionality & Usage
📋 Todo Management (/todos)
Add Tasks: Users can enter task descriptions into the input field to add them to the list.

Task Status: Tasks can be marked as "Completed," which applies a visual strike-through effect.

Filtering: Users can toggle between three views:

All: Displays every task in the list.

Completed: Displays only tasks that have been checked off.

Incomplete: Displays only the tasks remaining.

Delete: Users can permanently remove tasks from their list.

📧 Contact Form (/contact)
Includes fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, and Comments.

Utilizes Controlled Components, meaning the application state is updated instantaneously with every keystroke.

Technologies Used
React.js: Core library for building the user interface.

HTML5: Semantic structure for the application views.

CSS3: Custom styling for the layout and the "strike-through" task completion effect.

JavaScript (ES6+): Logic for filtering and state manipulation.

React Router: To handle navigation between the Todo and Contact views.

Future Improvements
To take this project to the next level, I plan to implement the following:

Local Storage Integration: Save todo items to the browser's local storage so that the list persists even after a page refresh.

Form Validation: Add real-time error handling to the Contact Form (e.g., ensuring a valid email format or requiring a minimum character count for comments).

Dark Mode Toggle: Implement a theme switch using React Context API to allow users to choose between a light and dark interface for better accessibility.
